# CNN classification of 102 Flowers 
### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have be-
come indispensable tools in computer vision tasks, particularly in
image classification. This paper explores the architecture design
and optimization techniques to enhance the performance of a
CNN model for flower classification using the Flowers102 dataset.
The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying
flower images into 102 categories. The study presents five CNN
models, each with iterative adjustments in architecture and acti-
vation functions, evaluated based on validation and test accuracy
scores. Results indicate variations in model performance, with
insights into architecture design and optimization strategies for
flower classification tasks.
